The best way I came up with in order to learn Python was to write codes to solve simple tasks.

In this folder I am collecting the codes that I have written to solve the exercises listed on projecteuler.com.

Before learning Python, I solved some of the exercises using GAP. Unfortunately I do not have the codes for them.
