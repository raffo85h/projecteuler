The best way I came up with in order to learn Python was to write codes to simple problems.

In this folder, I am collecting the codes that I write to solve the exercises listed on projecteuler.com.

Before learning Python, I solved some of the exercises using GAP. Unfortunately I do not have the codes for them.
